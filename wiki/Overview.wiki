= Introduction =

This project was born out of necessity because of the need to manage groups and users from a non-Windows computer (though you can use Windows if you want).  py-ad-ldap allows you to make most common operations on Active Directory objects.  It uses the python-ldap module and OpenSSL libraries, but is otherwise pure Python.

= Details =

The basic workflow for using this module is:

  # Create an *ad_ldap.Domain* object
  # *Connect()* to a domain controller
  # *Search()* using ldap filters or one of the convenience methods.  This will return *ad_ldap.ADObject* objects, a generic class for Active Directory objects, or you can use the *object* argument to return a *User*, *Computer*, *Group*, or *Container* object which inherits from ADObject and adds more methods
  # Read properties from the *properties* dict
  # If you modify properties, use the SetProperties() method to write them back to Active Directory
